## TODO
1. ~Add link to play store for the app (Right now it shows a static content from the database).~ - No internet, so this is the best option.
2. Step by step guidance to use this tool - README.md
3. Troubleshooting document
4. ~Check `MobileDevice/` to write a python script that can do the scanning stuff.~   (Does not work on python3!!)


5. Search for appIds with spy
6. IOS how to uninstall the apps. 




## Data TODO
1. A csv file containing all the `appIds`,
`store`={'android', 'ios', 'offstpre'}, and `flag`={'dual-use', 'spyware'}
2. A file containing `appId`, `name`, and `url` of all apps we have seen so far.
